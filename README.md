# pacpak
A pacman wrapper to manage installed flatpaks with pacman. This is still starting out and more of a proof of concept than a product.

## TODO

PR/issues are very welcome.  

I want to handle:
### Q\[ilo\]
info/list files/owns file  
`flatpak [list|info] `  
`flatpak info --show-runtime --show-extensions <app-id>` (shows dependecies)  

### R\[ns\]
`flatpak uninstall`
### S\[yu\]
`flatpak update`
### F?
